# Into the Crypt

*A cleric descends into darkness to put restless souls to peace.*

---

**Character:** Brother Marcus (Human Cleric)
**Background:** Acolyte
**Location:** The Abandoned Cemetery

---

### Turn 1

**Player:** I hold my holy symbol aloft and pray for guidance as I approach the crypt entrance.

**DM:** The worn silver amulet of your deity catches the pale morning light as you raise it high. Your whispered prayer echoes softly in the still air, and for a moment, you feel a warm presence settle over your shoulders like a protective cloak.
Rolling Religion... 11 vs DC 12 - not quite!

Your prayer feels sincere but somehow incomplete, as if the words don't quite carry the weight they should. The divine connection you seek remains just out of reach - perhaps your faith wavers slightly in the face of this dark place, or the unhallowed ground itself interferes with your communion.

Still, the familiar weight of the holy symbol in your hand provides some comfort as you stand before the crypt entrance. The stone archway looms before you, carved with weathered symbols that time has nearly erased. Moss clings to the cracked masonry, and the iron gate hangs slightly ajar, its hinges black with rust.

From within the darkness beyond the gate, you catch the faintest whisper of stale air - carrying with it the unmistakable scent of old stone and something else... something that makes your skin crawl.

What do you do, Brother Marcus?

### Turn 2

**Player:** I cast Light on my holy symbol and descend the stairs into the darkness.

**DM:** Your holy symbol flares to life with pure, white radiance that banishes the shadows around you. The light feels warm and clean against the oppressive atmosphere of this place.
Your blessed light reveals worn stone steps leading down into a rectangular chamber. The walls are carved with faded murals depicting robed figures in procession, their faces long since weathered away. Water stains streak down from the ceiling, and patches of slick moss make the footing treacherous.

At the far end of the chamber, two passages branch off into deeper darkness - one to the left curves away beyond your light's reach, while the right passage appears to descend further with what looks like more carved reliefs along its walls.
Rolling Perception... 19 vs DC 12 - success!

Your enhanced awareness picks up subtle details: the faint sound of dripping water echoes from the left passage, while a barely perceptible draft of colder air flows from the right. More concerning, you notice dark stains on the stone floor near the right passage - old, but unmistakably blood.

Fresh scratches in the moss also catch your eye - something has passed through here recently, and the claw marks suggest it wasn't human.

Which passage do you choose, Brother Marcus?

---

### Turn 3

**Player:** I stop and listen. What sounds do I hear from the depths?

**DM:** You pause in the chamber, holding your breath and straining your ears to catch any sounds from the depths ahead.
Rolling Perception... 12 vs DC 14 - not quite!

The silence seems almost absolute at first. Your own breathing and heartbeat sound thunderous in your ears, making it difficult to focus on more subtle sounds.

From the left passage, you can still make out that steady *drip... drip... drip* of water - probably just moisture seeping through ancient stone. But beyond that, the darkness swallows sound as thoroughly as it does light.

The right passage with its bloodstains remains ominously quiet. If anything lurks down there, it's either very still... or very good at moving silently.

The weight of centuries seems to press down on you in this place. Your light creates a small bubble of safety, but you're acutely aware that anything could be watching from just beyond its reach.

The scratches in the moss seem fresher now that you're looking more closely - perhaps made within the last few days.

Do you choose a passage, or take some other action?

### Turn 4

**Player:** I ready my mace and call out: 'In the name of the Light, I come to grant you rest!'

**DM:** You raise your mace high and let your voice ring out through the stone chamber. The sacred words echo off the walls, but they sound smaller and less commanding than you intended in this vast, ancient place.

Rolling Intimidation... 8 vs DC 15 - not quite!

Your challenge is answered almost immediately.

A low, guttural moan drifts from the right passage, followed by the scrape of something heavy dragging across stone. Then another moan joins it - and another. The sounds of shambling footsteps echo from the darkness, growing louder.

From the shadows of the right passage, three figures emerge into your light's reach. Once human, now they are corpses in various states of decay - their burial shrouds hanging in tatters, flesh gray and mottled, empty eye sockets fixed on you with hungry malevolence.

The undead seem more annoyed than intimidated by your declaration. One still wears the remnants of what might have been noble's clothing, while another clutches a rusted dagger in skeletal fingers.
The shambling dead advance with surprising determination. It's your turn, Brother Marcus! The three zombies are about 20 feet away, moving slowly but steadily toward you. Your holy symbol still blazes with light, and your mace is ready.

What do you do?

### Turn 5

**Player:** I hold forth my holy symbol and attempt to Turn Undead!

**DM:** You thrust your blazing holy symbol forward, its radiant light flaring even brighter as you call upon your divine training. The sacred light cuts through the darkness like a blade.
Your divine power surges through the chamber like a thunderclap of pure faith! The holy light becomes almost blinding as it washes over the undead.

**Zombie 1** - Rolling Wisdom save... 6 vs DC 13 - failure! The creature recoils with a shriek, stumbling backward into the passage it came from, its rotting hands raised to shield itself from your radiance.

**Zombie 2** - Rolling Wisdom save... 15 vs DC 13 - success! The noble-garbed zombie pushes through your turning attempt, its hollow sockets fixed on you with malevolent determination.

**Zombie 3** - Rolling Wisdom save... 7 vs DC 13 - failure! This one also staggers away with a mournful wail, fleeing back toward the right passage alongside its companion.

Two of the three undead are now turned, forced to flee from your holy presence for the next minute! They shamble desperately away from you, unable to approach or attack.
The turned zombie continues its retreat, shambling further down the right passage until it's beyond your light's reach. Its terrified moans echo from the darkness.
The second turned zombie follows its companion, fleeing deeper into the crypt with panicked groans.
But the remaining zombie - the one in noble's garb - resisted your divine power! It lurches forward, closing the distance with surprising speed. Its clawed hands reach for you with mindless hunger.
Rolling attack... 10 vs AC 10 - hit! The zombie's rotting fingers rake across your robes, tearing fabric but barely scratching your skin.
The impact drives you back a step, pain flaring across your chest where the creature struck you. You're badly hurt - the zombie's supernatural strength behind that blow was devastating!
**Your turn, Brother Marcus!** You're bloodied and in serious danger. The remaining zombie stands within reach, its dead eyes fixed on you hungrily. The two turned zombies have fled deeper into the crypt but will return in about a minute if you don't finish this quickly.

You can attack with your mace, cast a spell, try to retreat, or attempt another divine ability. What do you do?

### Turn 6

**Player:** I pursue the remaining undead, determined to cleanse this place.

**DM:** You grip your mace tighter and advance on the remaining zombie, your holy symbol's light casting dancing shadows on the walls as you move forward with grim determination.

The undead creature doesn't retreat - it meets your advance with outstretched claws, its jaw hanging open in a soundless snarl. The stench of decay fills your nostrils as you close to striking distance.

Rolling attack with mace... 16 vs AC 8 - hit! Rolling damage... 6 bludgeoning damage!

Your mace crashes into the zombie's skull with a wet, crunching sound. Bone fragments and dark ichor spray across the chamber floor as the creature's head caves in partially. It staggers but remains standing, now looking even more grotesque with its partially collapsed skull.
From the darkness of the right passage, you hear the shambling footsteps of the first turned zombie growing fainter - it continues its terrified retreat deeper into the crypt, still under the effect of your divine turning.
The second turned zombie also continues fleeing, its moans echoing from somewhere in the depths. Both creatures remain turned and cannot approach you.
The damaged zombie before you lashes out again, its remaining claw seeking your throat!
Rolling attack... 13 vs AC 10 - hit! 
The zombie's claw rakes across your chest with bone-crushing force! The impact sends you crashing to the stone floor, your mace clattering away into the darkness. Your vision blurs as consciousness fades - the cold stone against your cheek is the last thing you feel before everything goes black.

**Brother Marcus has fallen unconscious!** You are dying and must begin making death saving throws. 
**Your turn - Death Saving Throw:** You lie motionless on the cold stone, your life hanging by a thread. The zombie looms over your unconscious form, but for now you must focus on clinging to life itself.
Rolling death save... 9 - failure!

Your breathing grows more shallow as darkness presses in around your consciousness. Death's cold grip tightens, but you're still fighting. You have one failure - two more and your journey ends here in this cursed place.

The zombie above you prepares to strike your helpless form...
