*A lone fighter stumbles into a goblin trap on the forest road.*

**Character:** Kira Stonefist (Dwarf Fighter)
**Background:** Soldier
**Location:** The Forest Road

### Turn 1

**Player:** I cautiously walk down the forest path, keeping my hand on my axe.

**DM:** You move carefully along the winding forest path, your boots crunching softly on fallen leaves and twigs. The morning sun filters through the dense canopy above, casting dappled shadows that dance and shift with each gentle breeze. Your hand rests on the familiar weight of your axe, ready to draw at the first sign of trouble.

The air is crisp and carries the earthy scent of moss and decomposing wood. Somewhere in the distance, a bird calls out with a sharp trill, then falls silent. The forest feels alive around you, but there's an underlying tension - the kind of stillness that makes a soldier's instincts prickle.
Rolling Perception... 4 vs DC 12 - not quite! 

As you focus on the path ahead, your attention is drawn to the beauty of the morning forest rather than potential threats. A particularly colorful bird catches your eye as it flits between branches, and you find yourself momentarily distracted by the peaceful sounds of the woodland.

Suddenly, harsh voices shatter the morning calm - speaking in the guttural tongue of goblins! Before you can react, three small green-skinned creatures burst from the underbrush on either side of the path, crude weapons glinting in their clawed hands.

"Fresh meat!" one snarls in broken Common, raising a rusty scimitar.
Combat begins!

**Initiative Order:**
- **Goblin 2** (17)
- **Goblin 1** (15) 
- **Kira Stonefist** (13)
- **Goblin 3** (9)

**Round 1 begins!**

**Goblin 2's turn:** The goblin to your left darts forward with surprising speed, its scimitar slashing toward your side!
The goblin's blade finds its mark, slicing across your arm! 
**Goblin 1's turn:** The second goblin cackles with glee and lunges at you with its own scimitar!
This goblin's attack goes wide as you instinctively step back, the blade whistling past your chest!
**It's your turn, Kira!** 

You're surrounded by three goblins - one directly in front of you (Goblin 1), one to your left that just wounded you (Goblin 2), and one to your right preparing to attack (Goblin 3). Your hand is already on your axe, ready to draw and strike. All three goblins appear uninjured but their crude leather armor shows signs of wear.

What do you do?

*[Combat: HP 10/13, Player's turn: false]*

### Turn 2

**Player:** I stop and listen carefully. Is something moving in the bushes?

**DM:** I understand you want to be cautious, but we're already in the middle of combat! Three goblins have ambushed you and are actively attacking - there's no time to stop and listen as they're right in front of you with weapons drawn.

You're currently in **Round 1** of combat, and it's your turn to act. The goblins have already spotted you and two have attacked (one hit, one missed). You're surrounded and need to respond immediately.

**Current situation:**
- You've taken 4 damage and are at 9/13 HP
- Three goblins surround you with weapons ready
- Your hand is on your axe, ready to draw and fight

You need to choose a combat action:
- **Attack** one of the goblins with your handaxe
- **Draw a weapon** and attack  
- **Try to escape** the ambush
- **Take a defensive stance**

What's your combat action? The goblins won't wait while you listen - they're already attacking!

*[Combat: HP 10/13, Player's turn: false]*

### Turn 3

**Player:** I draw my axe and call out: 'Show yourselves, cowards!'

**DM:** Your axe slides smoothly from its loop as you raise it high, the steel head catching the dappled sunlight. "Show yourselves, cowards!" you bellow in your best military voice, the sound echoing through the trees.

The three goblins are already very much "shown" - they're standing right in front of you with weapons drawn! The one that wounded you cackles with malicious glee.

"We already here, stupid dwarf!" it shrieks back in broken Common. "You the one who gonna die!"

Since you're in combat and it's your turn, I'll assume you're drawing your handaxe to attack the most threatening goblin (the one that just hit you - Goblin 2).
Rolling attack... **21 vs AC 15 - hit!**
Your axe bites deep into the goblin's torso with a wet *thunk*, dark blood spraying across the forest floor! The creature's eyes go wide with shock and pain as it staggers backward, clutching the grievous wound.
**Goblin 3's turn:** The third goblin, seeing its companion badly wounded, snarls and rushes you from the right side with its scimitar raised!
The goblin's wild swing goes wide as you pivot away from your strike, its blade scraping harmlessly against a nearby tree trunk!
**Round 2 begins!**

**Goblin 2's turn:** The wounded goblin you just struck is bleeding heavily but still standing. It hisses in pain and fury, trying to return the favor with its scimitar!
Despite its wounds, the goblin's blade finds your thigh, opening another cut! 
**Your turn, Kira!** You're now bloodied but still fighting strong. The goblin you struck is badly wounded and bleeding, while the other two are uninjured. All three are within reach of your axe.

Blood runs down your leg, but your soldier's training keeps you focused. Which goblin do you target next?

*[Combat: HP 6/13, Player's turn: true]*

### Turn 4

**Player:** I charge at the nearest goblin with a battle cry!

**DM:** "FOR THE STONEFIST CLAN!" you roar, your battle cry echoing through the forest as you charge forward with your axe raised high! Your dwarven heritage burns in your veins as you close the distance to the nearest goblin.
Rolling attack... **22 vs AC 15 - hit!**
Your charge carries you straight into Goblin 1, your axe blade catching it across the shoulder as it tries to dodge! The goblin yelps in pain as your weapon opens a red line across its leather armor.
**Goblin 1's turn:** The goblin you just struck snarls with rage, pressing its attack despite the fresh wound bleeding down its arm!
The wounded goblin's counter-attack is clumsy and desperate - its scimitar swipes wildly through the air as you duck under the blade!
**Goblin 3's turn:** The third goblin tries to flank you while you're engaged with its wounded companion!
But your soldier's instincts serve you well - you sense the attack coming and sidestep, causing the goblin to stumble past you as its blade finds only empty air!
**Round 3 begins!**

**Goblin 2's turn:** The heavily wounded goblin you struck first is still standing but barely - blood drips steadily from its torso as it makes one more desperate attack!
The wounded goblin's scimitar finds its mark in a desperate strike, the rusty blade slicing deep across your chest! The combined wounds prove too much - darkness creeps in at the edges of your vision as you collapse to the forest floor, your axe tumbling from nerveless fingers.

**You are unconscious and dying!**

Blood pools beneath you as the goblins cackle with cruel delight. "Ha! Stupid dwarf down!" one shrieks. But you're not dead yet - your dwarven constitution fights to keep you alive.
**Your turn - Death Saving Throw:**
**Rolling death save... Natural 1 - TWO FAILURES!**

Your body convulses as life ebbs away. The wound is grievous, and your breathing becomes shallow and ragged. The goblins' voices seem to fade as darkness presses closer.

**Death Save Status: 2 failures, 0 successes** - One more failure means death!

The goblins start searching through your belongings, assuming you're finished. But fate hasn't claimed Kira Stonefist yet - you need one more round to determine your destiny.

What cruel twist of fate awaits? Will you stabilize, or will this be the end of your story?

*[Combat: HP 0/13, Player's turn: true]*

### Turn 5

**Player:** I swing my axe at the goblin in a wide arc.

**DM:** I understand you want to fight, but you're **unconscious at 0 HP** and cannot take any actions! When a character drops to 0 hit points, they fall unconscious and are incapacitated.

You're currently:
- Lying on the forest floor, bleeding
- Unconscious and unable to move, speak, or act
- Making death saving throws to determine if you live or die

**You cannot swing your axe, move, or do anything while unconscious.**

The only thing that happens on your turn is a death saving throw. You've already failed two death saves (including the critical failure that counted as two). One more failure means death, while three successes will stabilize you.

The goblins are still active and may attack your unconscious form, which would cause automatic death save failures. Any healing magic or aid would bring you back to consciousness, but right now you're helpless.

**It's still your turn for the death saving throw.** The dice will determine if you cling to life or slip closer to death.

Would you like me to continue with the next death saving throw, or do you understand the situation?

*[Combat: HP 0/13, Player's turn: true]*

### Turn 6

**Player:** I try to kick the goblin away and look for others.

**DM:** You're **unconscious at 0 HP** - you cannot kick, look, or take any actions whatsoever!

When you're unconscious:
- Your body won't respond to your commands
- You can't see, hear clearly, or move
- You're lying motionless on the forest floor
- The only thing keeping you alive is making death saving throws

**You cannot:**
- Kick anyone
- Look around
- Attack
- Move
- Speak
- Take any actions

**The only thing that happens on your turn is a death saving throw.**

You try to will your body to move, to fight back, but nothing responds. Your vision is black, your limbs are heavy and unresponsive. The goblins' voices sound distant and muffled as consciousness slips away from you.

**It's your turn - you must make a death saving throw:**

Rolling death save... **16 - SUCCESS!**

Your body fights against the darkness! Though still unconscious and bleeding, some spark of dwarven resilience keeps you from slipping further toward death.

**Death Save Status: 2 failures, 1 success**

You're still unconscious and cannot act. The goblins continue their turn...
