# The Heist

*A cunning rogue infiltrates the merchant lord's manor.*

**Character:** Shadow (Halfling Rogue)
**Background:** Criminal
**Location:** Outside the Manor Walls

### Turn 1

**Player:** I observe the manor from the shadows, watching the guard patrol patterns.

**DM:** You press yourself against the rough stone of the garden wall, using the morning shadows cast by an old oak tree to conceal your small frame. The manor looms before you - a three-story stone edifice with tall windows and ornate balconies that speak of old money and older secrets.

Your keen eyes track the movement of the guards as they make their rounds. Two guards patrol the front grounds in a lazy circuit, their leather armor creaking softly as they walk. They seem more concerned with staying warm than staying alert - their route takes them around the main courtyard every ten minutes or so.
Rolling Perception... 17 vs DC 12 - success!

Your patient observation reveals several crucial details. The guards are following a predictable pattern - they pause at the front gate for a brief conversation before splitting up. One circles clockwise around the manor's east wing while the other heads west. There's a gap of about three minutes when the rear courtyard is completely unguarded.

You also notice a third guard stationed at what appears to be a servant's entrance on the manor's north side. He's leaning against the doorframe, occasionally glancing around but mostly focused on whittling a piece of wood. His position gives him a view of the back gardens but not the east wall where several ivy-covered trellises climb toward second-story windows.

A delivery wagon approaches the front gate, causing both front guards to converge and check the driver's papers. This creates an even longer window of opportunity.

What's your next move?

### Turn 2

**Player:** I wait for the guards to pass, then scale the garden wall.

**DM:** You crouch lower in the shadows, muscles coiled like a spring as you watch the two front guards amble past your position. Their boots crunch softly on the gravel path, voices carrying in low murmurs about the cold morning air. One complains about his shift ending late while the other chuckles about plans for the tavern later.

As their footsteps fade around the corner, you make your move.
Rolling Athletics... 9 vs DC 12 - not quite!

You spring from your hiding spot and leap toward the wall, fingers seeking purchase on the weathered stone. But the morning dew has made the surface slippery, and your boots scrape against the wall with a soft but audible *scritch* as you struggle to find a foothold.

Your first attempt fails, and you drop back to the ground with a muffled thud. From around the corner, you hear one of the guards pause in his conversation.

"Did you hear something?" comes a gruff voice.

"Probably just a cat," replies the other, though their footsteps have stopped moving.

You're still concealed by the oak's shadow, but the guards are now alert. The delivery wagon at the front gate provides some distraction, but you'll need to either try a different approach or wait for them to resume their patrol.

The ivy-covered trellises on the east wall catch your eye again - they might provide better handholds, though it would mean moving closer to where that third guard is positioned.

What do you do?

### Turn 3

**Player:** I press myself against the wall and search for an unlocked window or servant's entrance.

**DM:** You press yourself flat against the cold stone wall, moving with careful steps along its perimeter. The morning shadows provide good cover as you examine every potential entry point within reach.

Rolling Investigation... 13 vs DC 14 - not quite!

Your search reveals mostly disappointing results. The ground-floor windows are all fitted with sturdy iron bars - clearly the manor's owners aren't taking any chances. The few windows without bars are positioned too high to reach from the ground, and their glass panes appear to be latched tight from within.

You do discover a small door that appears to lead to a root cellar or storage area, but when you test the iron handle, it doesn't budge. The lock looks old but well-maintained. There's also what might be a servants' entrance around the east side, but it's uncomfortably close to where that whittling guard is stationed.

As you work your way around the wall, a sound makes you freeze - footsteps approaching from the direction you came. The guards must be continuing their patrol route, and they'll round this corner in moments.

From your current position, you can see the ivy-covered trellises more clearly now. They look sturdy enough to climb, leading to a second-story balcony with French doors. The third guard's line of sight would catch you partway up, but if you timed it right when he's distracted...

The footsteps are getting closer. You need to decide quickly.

What's your move?

### Turn 4

**Player:** I carefully pick the lock, taking my time to avoid making noise.

**DM:** You drop to one knee beside the small cellar door, pulling out your lockpicks with practiced ease. The old iron lock looks like it's seen decades of use, but that might work in your favor - sometimes the older mechanisms are simpler to manipulate.

Rolling Sleight of Hand... 16 vs DC 13 - success!

Your nimble fingers work the picks with the patience of a seasoned professional. The first pin clicks into place with barely a whisper of sound, then the second. You pause as footsteps pass nearby on the other side of the wall - one of the guards completing his circuit - but your positioning keeps you hidden in the shadow of a stone buttress.

The third pin proves stubborn, but you apply gentle pressure while listening to the lock's internal mechanism. *Click.* The fourth pin falls into place, and finally, with a barely audible *snick*, the lock surrenders.

You test the door handle slowly, and it turns smoothly in your grasp. The hinges are well-oiled and silent as you ease the door open just a crack. Cool, musty air flows out, carrying the scent of stored root vegetables and aged wine. Stone steps descend into darkness below.

From this vantage point, you can hear the guards resuming their casual conversation as they move away from your position. The cellar entrance appears to be unmonitored - servants probably use it regularly enough that the guards don't pay it much attention.

The dark passage beckons, offering a way inside the manor's lower levels.

Do you enter the cellar?

### Turn 5

**Player:** I slip inside and let my eyes adjust. What room am I in?

**DM:** You slip through the narrow opening and ease the door shut behind you, the lock clicking softly back into place. The sudden transition from daylight to darkness leaves you momentarily blind, but you remain perfectly still, letting your eyes gradually adjust to the gloom.

Slowly, the cellar's details emerge from the shadows. You're standing on a stone landing with worn steps descending into a long, arched chamber. The air is cool and dry, tinged with the earthy scent of stored vegetables and the rich aroma of aging wine.

To your left, wooden shelves line the wall, heavy with sacks of potatoes, turnips, and onions. Clay pots and barrels are stacked neatly beneath. To your right, an impressive wine collection stretches into the darkness - dozens of bottles resting in carved stone alcoves, some thick with dust that speaks of considerable age and value.

At the far end of the cellar, perhaps thirty feet away, another set of stone steps leads upward toward what must be the manor's main levels. A thin line of light seeps beneath what appears to be a heavy wooden door at the top of those stairs.

The cellar is silent except for the occasional *drip* of moisture somewhere in the darkness. No immediate signs of guards or servants - this appears to be simple storage space, likely visited only when supplies are needed.

What's your next move?

### Turn 6

**Player:** I search for the merchant's study. That's where the documents would be.

**DM:** You know that a merchant's study would likely be on one of the upper floors - ground level at minimum, more likely the second floor where the family's private quarters and business affairs would be conducted. The cellar is purely for storage.

Moving carefully through the shadows, you approach the stone steps leading upward. Each footstep is placed with deliberate care to avoid any sound that might echo up through the door above.
Rolling Stealth... 7 vs DC 12 - not quite!

Halfway up the stairs, your foot finds a loose stone that shifts slightly under your weight, creating a small but distinct *scrape* against the step below. You freeze instantly, heart hammering as you listen for any response from beyond the door.

Voices drift through the heavy wood - servants, by the sound of it. A woman's voice: "...need more wine for tonight's dinner. Master Aldwin is expecting the Blackwater merchant."

"I'll fetch it after I finish with the silver," comes a man's reply, his footsteps moving away from the door.

The woman's voice grows closer. "No rush, but don't forget. You know how he gets when..."

Her words become muffled, but it's clear she's somewhere in the room beyond - likely the kitchen or servants' hall that connects to this cellar entrance. You'll need to either wait for her to leave, find another route, or risk a confrontation.

The thin line of light beneath the door suggests it's not locked - just closed. But opening it now would put you face-to-face with at least one servant.

What do you do?
