# The Wizard's Bargain

*An elf wizard seeks forbidden knowledge from a mysterious stranger.*

---

**Character:** Vaeris Moonwhisper (Elf Wizard)
**Background:** Sage
**Location:** The Dusty Archives

---

### Turn 1

**Player:** I search the ancient shelves for any texts on planar magic.

**DM:** You run your fingers along the dusty spines of countless tomes, squinting in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. The shelves stretch impossibly high, filled with volumes that seem to whisper secrets from ages past.

Your trained eye as a sage guides you through the chaotic organization, looking for the telltale symbols and arcane script that would indicate planar studies...
Rolling Investigation... 7 vs DC 13 - not quite!

The ancient filing system proves more cryptic than you anticipated. Dust motes dance in the air as you pull tome after tome from the shelves, but most contain mundane historical accounts or basic magical theory. The planar magic texts, if they exist here, are either well-hidden or filed under some archaic system you haven't yet deciphered.

As you replace a particularly heavy volume on "Agricultural Enchantments of the Third Era," you notice something peculiar. Several books on the higher shelves have been recently disturbed - there are clean rectangles in the dust where volumes once sat.

Someone else has been searching these archives recently, and they were looking for something specific.

A soft creaking sound echoes from deeper in the archives, as if someone - or something - is moving among the distant stacks.

What do you do?

---

### Turn 2

**Player:** I examine the strange tome more closely. What language is it written in?

**DM:** You pull the hefty "Agricultural Enchantments of the Third Era" back from the shelf and examine it more carefully. The leather binding is worn but well-preserved, and as you open the cover, flowing script reveals itself across yellowed pages.
Rolling Arcana... 5 vs DC 12 - not quite!

The script is elegant but unfamiliar to you. It's definitely not Common, nor any of the typical scholarly languages you'd expect in a human archive. The letters flow together in graceful curves that remind you vaguely of Elvish, but the structure is all wrong.

What catches your attention more than the language, however, is that this book feels oddly warm to the touch, and some of the ink seems to shimmer slightly in the dim light. The agricultural enchantments described in the illustrations - showing farmers tending to impossibly verdant crops under strange, multi-colored skies - don't look like they belong to this plane at all.

The creaking sound from deeper in the archives grows closer, accompanied now by what sounds like pages rustling. Someone is definitely moving through the stacks, and they're getting nearer to your location.

You could try to decipher more of this mysterious tome, investigate those disturbed spaces on the higher shelves, or deal with whoever is approaching through the archives.

What's your next move?

---

### Turn 3

**Player:** I attempt to read the inscription on the cover using my knowledge of arcane languages.

**DM:** You focus intently on the cover's inscription, drawing upon your years of study as a sage. The arcane symbols seem to dance before your eyes as you trace their flowing patterns with your finger...
Rolling Arcana... 6 vs DC 15 - not quite!

The flowing script continues to elude your understanding. While you recognize some of the fundamental arcane symbols - a few characters that denote magical transformation, and what might be elemental markers - the language remains frustratingly opaque. It's as if the words are written in a dialect of magic itself, one that predates the standardized arcane terminology you learned in your studies.

The warmth from the book seems to pulse gently against your palms, almost as if responding to your attempts to read it. One symbol near the bottom of the cover briefly flickers with a faint golden light before dimming again.

The footsteps in the archives have stopped. 

An uncomfortable silence settles over the dusty stacks, broken only by your own breathing. Whoever was moving through the archives knows you're here now - and they're listening.

A voice calls out from somewhere among the towering shelves, echoing strangely in the confined space: "Another seeker of forbidden knowledge, I presume? How... interesting."

What do you do?

---

### Turn 4

**Player:** Who approaches? I turn to face the stranger, one hand ready to cast Shield.

**DM:** You quickly tuck the mysterious tome under one arm and turn toward the voice, your free hand already tracing the somatic patterns for Shield in case you need to cast it quickly.

From between the towering shelves emerges a figure that makes you instinctively tense. A human woman in her middle years approaches, but there's something unsettling about her appearance. Her robes are fine quality but seem to absorb light rather than reflect it, and her eyes hold an intensity that speaks of dangerous knowledge.

Most unnervingly, she moves with complete silence despite the creaking floorboards that announced her presence moments ago.

"Ah, a fellow wizard," she says, noting your prepared stance with an amused smile. "I can sense the arcane energies about you. Tell me, young elf, what brings you to seek knowledge in these forgotten archives?"

Her gaze drops to the tome you're holding, and her expression shifts to one of keen interest. "And what exactly have you found there? That particular volume has been... elusive... for quite some time."

She stops about ten feet away - close enough for conversation, but far enough that you could react if she proves hostile. Her hands remain visible, but you notice she wears several rings that practically hum with magical energy.
How do you respond to her questions?

---

### Turn 5

**Player:** I listen carefully to the stranger's offer. What exactly does he want in exchange?

**DM:** I notice you mentioned "his offer" - but the stranger hasn't made any specific offer yet. The mysterious woman has only asked what brings you here and expressed interest in the tome you're holding.

She stands there expectantly, her unsettling gaze shifting between you and the warm book tucked under your arm. The silence stretches as she waits for your response to her questions about what you're seeking and what you've found.

The woman tilts her head slightly, her dark robes seeming to ripple despite the still air. "Come now, don't be shy. We're both scholars here, are we not? Perhaps we could be of mutual assistance to one another."

*Now* she's hinting at some kind of exchange, but she's waiting to hear what you're after before revealing what she might want in return.

The tome under your arm pulses with that strange warmth again, almost as if it's reacting to her presence.

What do you say to her questions? Do you tell her what you're searching for, or do you try to learn more about her first?

---

### Turn 6

**Player:** I consider the bargain. 'Knowledge for knowledge seems fair, but what assurance do I have?'

**DM:** The woman's smile widens at your cautious response, revealing teeth that seem just a bit too sharp. She clasps her hands together, the magical rings on her fingers chiming softly.

"Ah, a prudent question! Trust is indeed a precious commodity among those who traffic in dangerous knowledge." She gestures to the dusty archives around you. "But consider our circumstances - we are both here, both seeking what others dare not pursue."

She takes a half-step closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "As for assurance... I offer you this: I am bound by certain... *obligations*... that prevent me from directly harming those who deal with me honestly. A magical compact, you might say."

Her eyes gleam with an inner light that definitely isn't natural. "Besides, that tome you hold is far more dangerous than it appears. Without proper guidance, attempting to unlock its secrets could prove... unfortunate. I merely offer to share what I know of such texts, in exchange for learning what brought you to seek them."

The book under your arm grows noticeably warmer at her words, and you catch a faint whiff of something like sulfur in the air.

"So tell me, young seeker - what planar knowledge do you pursue? And perhaps more importantly... are you prepared for the consequences of finding it?"

What do you tell her?
