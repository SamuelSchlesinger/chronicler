**Location:** The Laughing Dragon Tavern

### Turn 1

**Player:** I survey the tavern crowd, tuning my lute. Who looks like they need cheering up?

**DM:** You pluck a few experimental notes on your lute, the familiar weight of the instrument comforting in your hands. The morning light filters through grimy windows, casting long shadows across the tavern's worn wooden floors.
Rolling Insight... 20 vs DC 12 - success!

Your keen eye sweeps the room, reading faces and body language with practiced ease. Three figures immediately catch your attention:

**At the bar**, a grizzled dwarf merchant slumps over his ale, muttering into his beard. His shoulders shake slightly - whether from anger or despair, you can't tell. His fine clothes are travel-stained, and a half-empty coin purse sits carelessly beside his elbow.

**In the corner booth**, a young human woman stares blankly at the wall, her untouched breakfast growing cold. Dark circles ring her eyes, and she clutches a crumpled letter in white-knuckled fingers. She looks like she hasn't slept in days.

**Near the fireplace**, an elderly halfling sits alone despite the early hour, nursing what's clearly not his first drink. He keeps glancing toward the door with hopeful eyes, then deflating when no one enters. A small wrapped gift sits on the table before him.

The rest of the tavern buzzes with typical morning energy - merchants planning routes, locals gossiping over porridge - but these three souls carry clouds of melancholy that your entertainer's instincts recognize immediately.
Which of these melancholy souls calls to your performer's heart? Or perhaps you'd prefer to start with a rousing song for the whole tavern to lift everyone's spirits at once?

### Turn 2

**Player:** I begin playing a lively tune and watch the crowd's reaction.

**DM:** Rolling Performance... 18 vs DC 13 - success!

Your fingers dance across the lute strings, launching into a spirited folk melody that bounces off the tavern walls. The tune is infectious - a rollicking drinking song that speaks of adventure, romance, and the joy of a warm hearth after a long journey.

The effect is immediate and magical. Conversations pause as heads turn your way, and within moments, feet begin tapping under tables. A group of merchants near the window start nodding along to the rhythm, and one even begins humming the harmony.

The tavern keeper - a stout woman with flour-dusted hands - grins broadly and starts wiping down mugs in time with your beat. "Now that's more like it!" she calls out. "Haven't heard music like that since the harvest festival!"

Even your three melancholy targets show signs of life: the dwarf's muttering stops as he glances up with interest, the young woman's grip on her letter loosens slightly, and the elderly halfling's foot taps almost involuntarily beneath his table.

A few copper coins clink into your open lute case as appreciative patrons toss tips your way. The entire atmosphere of the tavern has shifted - warmer, brighter, more alive.

As you reach the song's crescendo, you notice you have a choice: you could transition into another crowd-pleasing number to keep the energy high, or use this moment of goodwill to approach one of those troubled souls while their defenses are down.

What's your next move?

### Turn 3

**Player:** I use my Bardic Inspiration! I add a heroic verse about the sad-looking warrior in the corner.

**DM:** You seamlessly weave your magic into the melody, your voice rising with bardic power as you improvise a stirring verse. Your eyes lock with the young woman's as you sing:

*"And there sits a warrior, brave and true,  
Though shadows gather 'round her heart so blue,  
The dawn will break, the light will shine,  
Her courage strong as ancient wine!"*
The magical resonance of your inspiration washes over the tavern. The young woman straightens in her seat, her eyes widening with surprise and something that might be hope. The crumpled letter in her hand seems less important now, and color returns to her pale cheeks.

Around you, the entire tavern erupts in cheers and applause. "A toast to the warrior!" shouts the dwarf, raising his mug high. Other patrons follow suit, and suddenly the young woman finds herself the center of positive attention rather than curious stares.

She stands slowly, tucking the letter into her belt, and approaches your performance area with newfound determination in her step. As your song winds down, she speaks in a voice stronger than her appearance suggested:

"Thank you, bard. I... I needed to hear that." She glances around at the supportive faces, then back to you. "My name is Kara. I'm a town guard from Millbrook, three days' ride north. I came here seeking help, but..." She touches the letter at her belt. "Perhaps your song is the sign I needed."

The tavern has grown quiet, sensing a story in the making. What do you do?

### Turn 4

**Player:** I approach the warrior during my break. 'That's quite a sword you carry. There must be a story there.'

**DM:** You set your lute aside and approach Kara, who's now standing with straighter shoulders thanks to your bardic magic. Up close, you can see the sword she wears is indeed remarkable - the pommel bears intricate engravings of intertwining vines, and despite obvious use, the blade gleams with careful maintenance.

Kara's hand moves instinctively to the weapon's hilt at your comment, then she forces herself to relax. "You have a good eye," she says, a sad smile crossing her features. "This was my mentor's blade - Captain Thorne of the Millbrook Guard. He gave it to me when I made sergeant."

She pauses, the weight of memory heavy in her voice. "Was being the important word there. Three nights ago, something... *took* him. Along with half my patrol." Her jaw tightens. "The town council thinks I'm mad. They say wolves got them, or bandits. But I know what I saw."

The tavern's cheerful atmosphere seems to dim around your conversation. Kara pulls out the crumpled letter, smoothing it against the table. "This is from the mayor, 'relieving me of duty pending investigation.' They think I led good men to their deaths through incompetence."

Her eyes meet yours, and you see steel beneath the exhaustion. "But you called me a warrior in your song. Maybe... maybe you'd be willing to hear the real story? I came here hoping to find someone who'd believe me. Someone who'd help me prove what really happened."

What do you say to Kara?

### Turn 5

**Player:** I lean in closer. 'Tell me about the bounty. Perhaps I can help.'

**DM:** Kara blinks in surprise at your words. "Bounty?" She shakes her head, confusion flickering across her features. "I... I never mentioned a bounty. Though..." 

She pauses, studying your face with new interest. "You speak like someone who knows about such things. Are you an adventurer as well as a bard?"

She leans closer, lowering her voice to match yours. "There's no official bounty - the council won't even acknowledge there's a real threat. But I have my own savings, what little coin I've managed to put aside. If you're willing to help me investigate what happened to my patrol, to Captain Thorne..." 

Her hand moves to a small leather pouch at her belt. "I can offer thirty silver pieces. It's not much, but it's everything I have. More than that, if we can prove what really killed them, the town *should* pay proper bounty rates. Whatever stalks the Millbrook Woods has to be stopped before it kills again."

She searches your eyes earnestly. "But first, you need to hear what I saw that night. What took down five seasoned guards without leaving normal tracks or wounds. Will you listen?"

The tavern continues its morning bustle around you, but this corner has become an island of serious conversation.

How do you respond?

### Turn 6

**Player:** I consider the danger but also the opportunity. 'A song worth singing, then. Count me in.'

**DM:** Kara's eyes light up with the first genuine hope you've seen from her. Relief washes over her features as she clasps your hand firmly. "Thank you. You don't know what this means to me."

She glances around the tavern, then leans closer. "We were on evening patrol, following reports of missing livestock near the old mill ruins. Standard procedure - Captain Thorne, myself, and four others. But when we reached the treeline..."

Her voice drops to barely above a whisper. "The horses went mad. Absolutely terrified, rearing and screaming like I've never seen. We had to dismount and tie them off, but they kept trying to bolt. That should have been our first warning."

She traces patterns on the wooden table with her finger. "The tracks we found weren't from any wolf or bear. Too large, wrong shape entirely. And the smell..." She shudders. "Like rotting meat and sulfur mixed together."

"Captain Thorne ordered us to investigate in pairs, stay within sight of each other. But the fog rolled in so thick we could barely see our own hands. Then the screaming started."

Kara's knuckles whiten as she grips her sword hilt. "When the fog cleared at dawn, I was the only one left alive. The others... they were drained, Lyra. Not torn apart like an animal attack. *Drained*. Like something had sucked the very life from them."

She meets your eyes. "Will you come with me to Millbrook? Help me find this thing before it kills again?"
