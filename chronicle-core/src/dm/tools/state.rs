//! State assertion and inference tools.
//!
//! These tools provide a simpler, more declarative way to track state changes,
//! automatically capturing the "why" along with the "what". The `assert_state` tool
//! is designed to be easier for AI models to use correctly compared to fine-grained
//! update tools.

/// Assert a state change declaratively.
///
/// This tool provides a simpler alternative to `update_npc`, `move_npc`, etc.
/// by allowing declarative state assertions that capture both the change and its reason.
pub fn assert_state() -> Tool {
    Tool {
        name: "assert_state".to_string(),
        description: r#"Declaratively assert a state change for any entity in the game world.

This is a SIMPLER alternative to update_npc, move_npc, and similar tools. Use it when:
- An NPC's disposition changes after player interaction
- An entity's location changes
- An NPC's status changes (alive/dead/injured/missing)
- A relationship between entities changes

The tool automatically records the reason for the change, creating a richer narrative history.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Call this tool whenever player actions or story events cause state changes!
If the player helps an NPC and they smile warmly → assert_state(entity_name="Mira", state_type="disposition", new_value="friendly", reason="Player saved her shop from bandits")
If an NPC moves somewhere → assert_state(entity_name="Guard Captain", state_type="location", new_value="Northern Gate", reason="Responding to alarm")
If the player befriends someone → assert_state(entity_name="Mira", state_type="relationship", new_value="ally", target_entity="Player", reason="Trust built through shared adventure")"#.to_string(),
