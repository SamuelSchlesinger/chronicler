        description: r#"Schedule a future event that will trigger based on time passage.

Use this when:
- An NPC says "meet me at the tavern tomorrow at noon"
- A festival or market has a specific start time
- A patrol will arrive in 30 minutes
- A curse will take effect at midnight
- Any timed deadline or appointment exists

The event will be tracked and you'll be notified when time passes and the event should trigger.

TIME SPECIFICATION:
- Use `minutes` and/or `hours` for relative time from now (e.g., "in 2 hours")
- Use `day`, `month`, `year`, `hour` for absolute time (e.g., "on day 5 at noon")
- Use `daily_hour` and `daily_minute` for recurring daily events (e.g., "every day at 8:00")

VISIBILITY:
- "public": Player knows about this event (appointments, announced festivals)
- "private": Player doesn't know (ambushes, secret meetings)
- "hinted": Player knows something will happen but not details

Examples:
- Guard patrol arrives: schedule_event(description="Town guard patrol arrives at the east gate", minutes=30, location="East Gate")
- Festival tomorrow: schedule_event(description="The Harvest Festival begins", day=5, hour=10, location="Town Square", visibility="public")
- Daily market: schedule_event(description="The morning market opens", daily_hour=8, daily_minute=0, repeating=true)"#.to_string(),
