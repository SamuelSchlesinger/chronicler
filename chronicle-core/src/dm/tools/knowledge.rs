Use this when:
- An NPC learns something from the player
- The player learns something from an NPC
- An NPC tells another NPC something
- An entity witnesses an event
- You want to track secrets, rumors, or information asymmetry

The verification_status indicates whether the information is:
- "true" - Verified fact
- "false" - Deliberate lie or misinformation
- "partial" - Contains both true and false elements
- "unknown" - Rumor or unverified information
- "outdated" - Was true but is no longer current

Examples:
- Player tells Mira about the haunted mine: share_knowledge(knowing_entity="Mira", content="The old mine is haunted by undead", source="player", verification="true")
- Bartender spreads a rumor: share_knowledge(knowing_entity="Various Patrons", content="The baron is bankrupt", source="Bartender Joe", verification="unknown")
- NPC lies to player: share_knowledge(knowing_entity="Player", content="The treasure is in the east tower", source_entity="Treacherous Guard", verification="false")"#.to_string(),
